# Face_detection-AWS-Whatsapp-Mail

This program features some exclusive applications of face detection. It registers and recognizes faces of 2 persons and performs tasks. When it recognizes the face of person "1" as registered, it sends a mail to the mail ID input before itself, and a text to a person whose phone no. is added, both of which- text and phone no. is input before.

When it recognizes the face of "2" person, it launches an EC2 instance in AWS, creates a volume of 5GiB and attaches it to the instance.

NOTE: Make sure whatsapp web is logged in the browser, or you'll have to login first and due to which the wait time might exceed and the text is not delivered.
